# Automating the Boring stuff with scripts 
## count_lines.sh 
- This script prints lines of text (non-empty lines) in each files of a specific directory recursively until it prints that for all the files in that directory.
- This script is called with the directory path in which you want to print the files name with the non-empty lines number in front of them.
- `./count_lines.sh /file/path`
